# Leviathan's Lair

## About
Leviathan's Lair is a game where you play as a submarine and you battle against deep sea creatures and monters, ultimately fighting the leviathan.
You can shoot at boulders to receive pickups such as shield and hearts.

 ### Game Inspiration
 Below are a list of games that I took inspiration from:
 
 #### Asteroids
 The mechanics of the game are very similar but I have customised it by
 allowing the submarine to move freely, adding pickups, including enemy types 
 and a boss battle
 
 #### Super Mario Bros
 I took inspiration for the pickups from the mechanic of hitting blocks in Super Mario
 
 #### Crash Bandicoot
 The enemy types were inspired by the underwater levels in Crash Bandicoot
 
 #### Subnautica
 The theme of the game was inspired by Subnautica. Also the jellyfish 
 shooting electricity was inspired by the [Crabsquid](https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Crabsquid) in the 
 game.
